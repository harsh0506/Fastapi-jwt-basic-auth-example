 **1. Install Anaconda and Set Up Anaconda:**
Download and install Anaconda from the official website: https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

**2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**
Open your terminal or command prompt and execute the following commands:

```bash
# Create a new Conda virtual environment
conda create --name myenv

# Activate the virtual environment
conda activate myenv
```

Replace `myenv` with the name you want to give to your environment.

**3. Install Dependencies from `requirement.txt`:**
Make sure you have a `requirement.txt` file with the list of dependencies required for your project. Navigate to the directory containing the `requirement.txt` file and run:

```bash
conda install -r requirement.txt
```

This will install the dependencies into the currently active Conda environment.

**4. Run the Application using Uvicorn:**
Assuming you have a Python application named `app.py` with an instance named `app`, run the following command to start the application using Uvicorn:

```bash
uvicorn app:app --reload
```

Replace `app:app` with the appropriate module and instance names from your application.

**5. Docker Container Setup and Running:**
Assuming you have a Dockerfile for your application, follow these steps to create and run a Docker container:

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t simple-flask-auth_v1 .

# Run the Docker container
docker run -p 8000:8000 simple-flask-auth_v1
```

Replace `simple-flask-auth` with a suitable name for your Docker image.

**6. Login Credentials:**
You provided the following login credentials:
- Username: user@101
- Password: user@101

Please note that these are just examples and should be replaced with actual login credentials for your application.

Please adapt these instructions to your specific project structure and requirements.
